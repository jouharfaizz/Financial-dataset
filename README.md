4. **Year-over-Year Comparison:**
   - Detailed comparison of financial metrics across different years.
   - Visual representation of growth or decline in revenue and profits.

5. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

## Visualizations
The Power BI report includes several visuals to effectively communicate financial trends and metrics:
- **Line Chart:** Revenue and expense trends over time.
- **Bar Chart:** Comparison of profit margins across different years or months.
- **Pie Chart:** Distribution of expenses by category.
- **Card Visuals:** Key financial KPIs such as total revenue, total expenses, and net profit.
